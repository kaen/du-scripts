# Dual Universe Artificial Horizon

Usage:

1. Connect a core and a screen to your Board or Cockpit
2. Paste the contents of system_update.lua at the top of the system -> update handler
3. Turn it on, it should *just work*

Blue is sky, tan is land. If your cursor is centered on the line between them
(and you have sufficient lift) you will maintain your current altitude. You can
put the screen, the core, and the programming board (or cockpit) wherever you
like, in whatever orientation you like. It will always be accurate for the
"front" of the construct.
